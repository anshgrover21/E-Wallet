## E-Wallet Backend System

**Overview**

This microservices-based e-wallet backend system offers a robust and scalable solution for managing user accounts, wallets, transactions, and notifications. It leverages Spring Boot for a streamlined development experience and utilizes Kafka for asynchronous inter-service communication, ensuring high availability and performance.

**Technologies**

* **Microservices Architecture:** Breaks down the system into independent, loosely-coupled services, promoting maintainability and scalability.
* **Spring Boot:** Provides a rapid application development framework for building RESTful APIs efficiently.
* **JPA and Hibernate:** Offer an object-relational mapping (ORM) layer for database interactions, simplifying data persistence.
* **SQL:** Used for structured data storage within the relational database.
* **Apache Kafka:** Enables asynchronous messaging for communication between services, improving system resiliency.
* **Spring Security:** Provides comprehensive security features such as authentication, authorization, and encryption.

**Key Services**

* **User Service:**
    * Manages user creation, retrieval, and updates.
    * Handles user wallet creation and association.
* **Notification Service:**
    * Sends real-time notifications to users for registration confirmation, welcome messages, and transaction updates.
* **Transaction Service:**
    * Facilitates secure and reliable transaction processing.
    * Ensures atomicity (all-or-nothing) and consistency of transactions.
* **Wallet Service:**
    * Creates and manages user wallets.
    * Listens to Kafka messages for transaction updates and updates wallet balances accordingly.

**Flow Description**

* **User Registration and Wallet Creation:**
    1. User Service receives a user registration request.
    2. User Service creates a new user record and publishes a Kafka message indicating successful user creation.
    3. Wallet Service subscribes to user creation messages and automatically creates a corresponding wallet for the new user.
    4. Notification Service receives a Kafka message for user creation.
    5. Notification Service sends a registration confirmation and welcome notification to the user.
* **Transaction Management:**
    1. User initiates a transaction through the Transaction Service API.
    2. Transaction Service securely processes the transaction details.
    3. Upon successful transaction:
        *  Transaction Service sends a Kafka message containing transaction details to the Wallet Service for balance update.
        *  Wallet Service receives the message, updates the user's wallet balance atomically (all-or-nothing operation).
    4. In case of transaction failure or wallet update failure:
        *  Transaction Service triggers a rollback through Kafka messages, ensuring data consistency.
* **Transaction History and Retrieval:**
    * Transaction Service provides APIs for retrieving paginated transaction history, allowing users to customize page size and navigate through records.

**Benefits**

* **Atomicity and Consistency:** Kafka guarantees atomic updates across services, ensuring transactions are either fully completed or rolled back in case of failures, maintaining data integrity.
* **Scalability and Reliability:** Independent microservices enable scaling individual components without impacting the entire system. Asynchronous Kafka messaging enhances system reliability by decoupling services and preventing bottlenecks.

**Conclusion**

This e-wallet backend system delivers a secure, scalable, and flexible solution for managing user accounts, wallets, transactions, and notifications. The chosen technologies and microservices architecture empower you to build a robust e-wallet platform for your users.

**Additional Considerations**

* **Security:** Implement robust security measures in each service, including secure authentication, authorization, and data encryption.
* **Documentation:** Develop comprehensive API documentation for each service to facilitate integration with mobile or web applications.
* **Monitoring and Logging:** Integrate monitoring and logging solutions to track system health, identify potential issues, and ensure smooth operation.
* **Testing:** Implement a robust testing strategy to ensure code quality, service functionality, and system behavior under various conditions.

By following these guidelines, you can create a well-structured, secure, and scalable e-wallet backend system that caters to the needs of your users and your business.
